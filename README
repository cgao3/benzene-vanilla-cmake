Project Benzene README

----------
 Building
----------

You will need the fuego includes and library objects. To get them,
checkout fuego from sourceforge.net. For example, from within your
benzene directory:

% cd ..
% svn co https://fuego.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fuego/trunk fuego
% cd fuego
% aclocal
% autoheader
% autoreconf -i
% ./configure --enable-assert  --enable-optimize 

(NOTE: This current build of Benzene is tested with revision 864
(circa May 2009). It is possible that in the future the trunk version
of fuego can differ drastically from this version. It may be necessary
to checkout a branch in the fuego repository created near revision 864
to get the compile to work, or to checkout revision 864 itself with
the "-r 864" option to "svn co".)

Include the "--enable-assert" if you will be doing development on
Benzene. The compilation will fail if you want to use assertions in 
Benzene but not in Fuego. 

If you will not be doing development or testing, or would prefer
maximum speed and performance, then you can safely exclude the
"--enable-assert" option.

By default fuego is not built with optmizations on. Use "--enable-optimize"
for O3 level optimization. Not doing this results in very slow code.

% make

Change back to the benzene directory. 

% cd ../benzene

If you checked out your benzene code from a git repository you will need
to run autotools to create your configure script. If you downloaded a
distribution tarball, go straight to the 'configure' step.

% aclocal
% autoheader
% autoreconf -i

This should complete without error. 

Now run configure (skip to here if you downloaded a benzene tarball): 

% ./configure FUEGO_ROOT=[absolute path to fuego] --enable-assert=yes

FUEGO_ROOT simply tells benzene where it can find the fuego files it
needs.  Do not use a relative path as this will cause an error in the
next step, ie, do not use "FUEGO_ROOT=../fuego/".

Recall that if you compiled Fuego without assertions then you cannot use
assertions in Benzene, and so you should leave off the assert option
to 'configure'.

If you want to support boardsizes up to 13x13, include the option
"--enable-upto13x13=yes". This will degrade performance, so only use
this if you want to play on 13x13.

If you want to support boardsizes up to 14x14, include the option
"--enable-upto14x14=yes". This will degrade performance a little more
(and will override the 13x13 option), so only use this if you want to
play on 14x14.

If you want to support boardsizes up to 19x19, include the option
"--enable-upto19x19=yes". This will degrade performance even further,
so again, only use this if you want to play on very large boards. This
option supercedes "--enable-upto13x13" and "--enable-upto14x14", so if
you use "--enable-upto19x19" only it will have any effect.

'configure' should finish without error. If 'configure' fails to find
BOOST or BerkeleyDB, you may need to direct it to those files
explicitly (good luck, buddy!).  If all is well, then do:

% make

This will build everything. If you have a multi-core processor, do
"make -j#" where # is the number of cores you wish to use. This will
greatly speed up the build process.

MoHex and Wolve executables can be found under src/mohex/ and src/wolve
respectively. 

To build and run the unit tests, do:

% make check
% src/test/benzene_unittests

-------------
 Development
-------------

If you are only modifying existing source files, then a simple 'make'
is enough to build the new code properly. If you wish to add or remove
source files, then you will have to edit the proper 'Makefile.am'
files.  If you modify any 'Makefile.am', you will need to run
'autoreconf -i' and 'configure' again. That is:

[add some source files, make changes in all relevant Makefile.am]
% autoreconf -i
% ./configure FUEGO_ROOT=[abs path to fuego-0.3] --enable-assert=[yes/no]
% make

------------
 Installing
------------

If you just want to run benzene, you should do a 'make install'
after 'make'. See the file INSTALL.
