Benzene 1.0 (current development version)
-----------------------------------------
* Small code changes:
  * moved code in src/uct/ to src/mohex/
  * lots of cleanup
* Wolve uses SgSearch from the smartgame library

* Removed support for the crossing rule during vc construction
* New website

Benzene 0.9 (released 10/10/02)
-----------------------------------------
* New DFPN solver
* Six no longer packaged with Benzene
* Wolve uses only a single board
* Non-edge vc templates (results in much better set of connections)
* Book commands/scripts to:
  * export leafs over a certain depth threshold
  * solve leafs with multiple concurrent dfpn threads
  * import solved leafs back into book

* Remove rotationally equivalent moves from set of considered moves
* Reversible moves
* Now hosted on sourceforge
* Code cleanup/bug fixes
  * HexBoard no longer derives from StoneBoard
  * No more GroupBoard and PatternBoard that derive off of StoneBoard
  * Different base hash for each boardsize
  * HexStates incorporating color to move are used instead of 
    (board, color) pairs
  * Book stuff in its own directory
  * More documentation

Benzene 0.8 (released 09/05/04)
-------------------------------
* New MoHex
  * Uses VC knowledge in search tree
  * Handles determined states during search  
* Book tools totally rewritten
  * Builder uses any BenzenePlayer evaluate positions
  * Multi-threaded
  * Handles swap moves
  * Progressive widening
* Parallel solver
* Code refactoring/cleanup

Benzene 0.7 (released 09/02/18)
-------------------------------
* Build system switched to autotools
* Separate executables for wolve and mohex 
* Support for boardsizes up to 19x19
* Boost::program_options for cmdline arguments
* Improved tournament scripts
* Upgraded to Fuego-0.3
* Players/solver interruptable
* Massive refactoring/cleanup

Benzene cg2008 (0.6.0) (released 08/10/17)
------------------------------------------
* Combinatorial decompositions
  * 4-sided decomps handled automatically by the board
  * Splitting decompositions used in Solver to decompose proof
* ICE improvements
  * Permanently inferior cells
  * Correctly handle captured carriers, etc.
  * Better incremental algorithm
  * Refactored/cleaned up code
* VC improvements
  * Push-rule
  * Edge-templates for difficult connections
  * Ladder-templates
  * Optimized (again!)
* Solver
  * Uses decompositions (as mentiond above)
  * Reduced number of played moves that need to be played
    (handle DB/TT checks in the move ordering phase, etc).
  * DB uses Berkeley DB instead of home-grown fileformat
  * Proof shrinking/transpositions
  * Many bugfixes
  * Can solve 7x7 in 15min and 8x8 in about 2 weeks. 
* Opening Book using self-play
* Time control
* Player runs Solver for a short time before generating
  a move: much improved endgame play.
* Wolve now around 200 ELO stronger than Six
* MoHex:
  * Around 100 ELO stronger than Six
  * Rollouts played from 1-ply filled-in boards
  * 1st and 2nd ply moves restricted to mustplay
  * Switched to Fuego v0.1
  * Multi-threading support
* Added Perfect player
* Added Handicap player
* More unit and regression tests

Benzene 0.4.1 (released 07/09/26)
---------------------------------
* Optimized VCs considerably.
* Wolve computes VCs through the edge; ~100 ELO stronger than Six. 
* Improved Inferior Cell Engine:
  * multiple vulnerable cell dominators; changed patterns to refelct this. 
  * iterates on ps-pairs.
  * computes vulnerable cells before dominated cells.  
* Six supports the htp commands: 'vc-build', 'vc-between-cells', and
  'vc-connected-to'.
* Default program settings loaded from /bin/config/defaults.  
* More unit/regression tests

Benzene 0.4.0 (released 07/09/12)
---------------------------------
* Unit tests.
* Doxygen documentation.
* Regression test suite. 
* Two distance and resistance evaluation functions. 
* Much improved Solver, including databases. 
* Endgame search
* Many, many code changes and enhancements. 
* Ported version of Six.

Benzene 0.2.0 (released 07/05/01)
---------------------------------
* Pattern based UCT player.
* Very primitive Solver.
* Multi-level logger. 
* No alphabeta player.
* Tournament scripts for automated playing.
